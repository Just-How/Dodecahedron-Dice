# Dodecahedron-Dice
Texture an object objects using triangles and/or quads. 

Construct a regular dodecahedron in any color you wish. Modify the texture and texture mapping so that each face has a unique value between 1 and 12. Use the existing perspective camera and rotational motion to show off the faces of your dodecahedron.

The program displays a colored dodecahedron with a single unique number from 1-12 visible on each face.
